The AsieLauncher is a launcher for custom modpacks. 

Given that asie has abandoned it (sort of), I've forked the project and am continuing development.

Created with the serious server administrator in mind, it allows all clients with the modpack to be automatically and incrementally updated when mods or configs change on the server. 

On the server side, the AsieLauncher uses Node.js, and a simple java client is generated specific to the server.

To install and use, please see the wiki.

To download the latest builds, check the [AsieLauncher Jenkins](http://jenkins.jakimfett.com/build/job/AsieLauncher/). Development builds are available from http://update.asielauncher.com/development
